Possibility of adding multiple nodes to the blockchain
Proof of Work (PoW)
Simple conflict resolution between nodes
Transactions with RSA encryption
The blockchain client has the following features:

Wallets generation using Public/Private key encryption (based on RSA algorithm)
Generation of transactions with RSA encryption
This github repository also contains 2 dashboards:
